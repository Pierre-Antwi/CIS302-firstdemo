	<h3>Wall Street</h3>
	<img src="wallstreet.jpg">
	<p>Wall Street, located in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City, is synonymous with the American financial industry. It's home to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization, as well as numerous financial institutions, investment banks, and brokerage firms. The term "Wall Street" has become a metonym for the U.S. financial sector and the broader financial market, representing the epicenter of trading, investment, and economic activity in the United States. Over the years, Wall Street has played a pivotal role in shaping the global economy, symbolizing both economic power and the complexities of the financial world. Despite its economic influence, Wall Street has also faced criticism and scrutiny, especially during financial crises, for its role in market fluctuations and its impact on broader societal issues.
